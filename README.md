Requirements
------------

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) **v0.10+**

Install
-------

1. Download the latest version of Lookup from the [releases page](https://github.com/wgalyen/Lookup/releases)
2. Create a new directory where you would like to run the app, and un-zip the package to that location
3. Fire up a Terminal, the Node Command Prompt or shell and change directory to the root of the Lookup application (where app.js and config.js are)
4. Run `npm install` to install the node dependencies
5. To start Lookup, run `npm start`
6. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser

Note: When running on a live site you'll want to set the `PORT` env variable to `80` so you don't need to add `:3000` to the URL.
